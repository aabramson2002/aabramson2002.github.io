        <ul>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <li>This project is a recreation of the shell game. Every time you press the shuffle button, the card containing the coin,
                either stays or place or changes places with another card. You must guess which card has the coin after shuffling.
            </li>

            <h4>Instructions/Features</h4>
            <li>If you click on each card, if it is the card that was holding the coin, the card transforms back into the coin, and
                you write down text saying that you won the game. If not, you lose and you can try again. Clicking the try again 
                button hides the coin back to where it was before and resets the shuffle counter to zero. 
            </li>

            <h4>Current Errors</h4>
            <li> There aren't any major errors but the cards can begin shaking or move on top of other cards if you try spamming
                the shuffle button without a significant part of the animation being finished. 
            </li>

            <h4>Requirements met</h4>
            <li>
                <a href="gameStyle.css">Style sheet</a>
            </li>
            <li>All html and css have been validated</li>
            <li>I added a sound of cards flipping in the game. The link to it is in references.</li>
            <li>The game uses the doucument object model (DOM) to work.
            <li>
                I use an ES6 class within my code called Card. This class is used to store the DOM element representing
                the card, it's current position which is either at 0, 200, or 400 pixels from the left, and the position
                the card will ultimately move to.
            </li>
                
            <h4>References</h4>
            <li> <a href = https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_animate.asp>DOM animation</a>
                <br>
                <p>This website was cricial to helping me understand how to animate elements by changing their position.</p>

                <br>
                <p>This site contains a free mp3 of cards shuffling that plays each time the player presses the shuffle button</p>

                <br>
                <p>This site helped me program the random function into my program</p>
            </li>

            <h4>Grading</h4>
            <li>I think this is a C grade, possibly B. I wish I could have done more work with it, but it hits every requirement, 
                and does notrun into any major errors that will ruin the experience.

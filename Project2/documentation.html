            <h4>Description</h4>
            <li>This project is a joke finder. You enter a word into the searchbar and it will find jokes in it with that word.
                There is also a button to disable searches that are NSFW (not safe for work) and a dropdown menu to sort out which 
                category you want the joke to be. These categories range from programming jokes, to puns, and even spooky jokes.
            </li>

            <h4>Instructions/Features</h4>
            <li>If you click the check mark underneath a joke, it will be highlighted yellow, indicating it's one of your favorites.
                Clicking the "X button" returns it back to it's original color.
                Clicking the "Favorites" button will take you to a different website where all of your favorite jokes are stored.
                By pressing the x in the favorites page, the joke dissapears and you can return back to the Joke finder.
            </li>

            <h4>Current Errors</h4>
            <li>This project currently is unable to properly load the JSON tags necessary for the jokes.
                While it is parsing the JSON file correctly. It is not retrieving the information and embedding it correctly.
                However, a link with the joke in it is produced by the code.js file. Click on it, and it will show you the joke
                generated by your searches.
            </li>
            <li>Only one word can be entered at a time in order for the link to work. If you want to enter a second word, 
                you have to refresh the page first. If you don't the link won't work because there must be %20 between each word,
                rather than the base tag.
            </li>

            <h4>Requirements met</h4>
            <li><a href = https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/#wrappers>https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/#wrappers</a></li>
            <li>The people at the Sv443 team have made a very expansive library of jokes (Over 1000 in fact) with multiple
                ways of sorting them including categories, safe for work content, and joke style.
            </li>
            <li>
                This has 3 different controls, with searches by a keyword, NSFW tag, and the category dropdown menu.
            </li>
            <li>All HTML and CSS is valid.</li>
            <li>CSS and javascript are on separate files from HTML.</li>
            <li>This website uses local storage to keep track of your last search. It might say Hi to you if you write it down again.
                It will be used for storing favorite jokes in the future.
            </li>
            <li>App states are hard to keep track of without console.log tags because they happen in milliseconds. Thank you
                fast internet.
            </li>
                
            <h4>References</h4>
            <li>I used code from Web Apps 9 to help get the dropdown menu to work</li>
            <li>I referenced the gif finder HW to structure how to read information from the API
                and use it to change parts of my website.
            </li>

            <h4>Grading</h4>
            <li>I definetly have to give myself a D for this project. It does not have all the features wanted, 
                and some of them don't work. However, I'm not letting a bad grade interfere with this website. I will continue
                to work on it until it is worthy of an A and I don't care how long it takes.

            </li>

            The purpose of this portfolio is to gain the attention of potential employers.
            Not only will the site represent a hub for all of the best work I have done throughout
            my college career, I could say that I programed the entire thing myself, showing first hand my
            programming skills. The website is going to be formatted using flexbox and css grid.
            It looks decent now but still has a long way to go.
            I used in the website, the web version of the Hussar Bold font from fontspace.com. I also
            used a sample 350x150 image from placeholder.com. 
            In the future, I plan to add visual effects using JavaScript to make it look more impressive,
            and continue to polish the overall aesthetic of my portfolio.

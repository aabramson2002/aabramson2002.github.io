            The purpose of this portfolio is to gain the attention of potential employers.
            Not only will the site represent a hub for all of the best work I have done throughout
            my college career, I could say that I programed the entire thing myself, showing first hand my
            programming skills. The website is formatted using Bulma CSS.
            I used in the website, the web version of the Hussar Bold font from fontspace.com.
            The website was originally hosted on RIT's banjo servers but since graduation,
            I have migrated the site to github pages.
            In the future, I plan to make the projects featured work better and have a cleaner design.
            Additionally, I hope to add more projects to the portfolio as I continue my career.

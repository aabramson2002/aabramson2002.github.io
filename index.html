                    This is a video of what I worked on over the Summer for the website of the upcoming video game
                    Changeling.
                    Changeling is an upcoming murder mystery VR game made by students and staff of RIT's school of
                    Interactive Games and Media.
                    On the website, there will be an experience for each character in the game and my responsibility was
                    the Father, Dylan.
                    In this game you go to the highlighted door, and select the item the family member is looking for.
                    Most of the images used were either already pre-loaded to the team's repo, or were stock images from
                    royalty free websites.
                    Some I even made myself with MS Paint and Gimp like the baby rattle, book, and hands that surround
                    Dylan as time progresses.
                    These hands represent him succombing to the anxiety and pressure of him thinking it's his
                    responsiblity always be there for his family.
                    If the screen goes black, the game ends. The experience is currently not uploaded to the site so I
                    made a video of how it works.

                <p>This is a video demo of a level I designed using Hammer++ and assets from Half-Life 2.
                    I created it as a part of my level design class, IGME 420. The level takes place in an
                    abandoned castle, and your mission as the player is to retake the castle back for
                    humanity. I stylized the castle to be abandoned by surrounding it with grafiti.
                    There are 3 sections to the map. The first is the outer walls, where you use a pistol
                    to defeat head crabs. Once you get past this section, you obtain an SMG and reach
                    the garden, where you have to stay on the bridge and take out more headcrabs. Lastly,
                    you get the crossbow, and enter the castle where a bossfight awaits.

                <p>This is a game modification of Fallout 4 that I helped work on. The mod is about locating
                    a special weapon that freezes enemies in time inside of a makeshift pre-war vault.
                    My responsiblity was to retexture the weapon so that it isn't visually identical to a
                    weapon already in-game. I also helped out with the level's design, figuring out where
                    in game, the environment should be established.

                    These are audio files I made for a game demo called "It's Scorpin time".
                    It is a 3D open world game where you are a scorpion mother who had her children whisked away during
                    a storm.
                    You must find all of your scorplings before the sun sets on the desert. Some of the audio repeats
                    so you do not have to listen the whole way through. Most of the audio was made using Beepbox.
                    Since it was in the desert, I went with a more western theme for the menu and background music.
                    Some cases like the walking was made by me tapping my fingers against the keyboard. It may not sound
                    exactly like how a scorpion usually walks, but the game takes place in a desert after rain so it
                    fits the scenery better.
                    The audio files I included in order are the walking sound, the game over music, the game's
                    background audio, the main menu music, the countdown music for when you are runnning out of time,
                    and the victory theme.

                <img src="Media/HiddenWithin.png" alt="Placeholder" class="placeholder py-3">
                <p> Hidden Within is a recreation of the shell game changed to a casino theme.
                    In it, a coin is hidden within a set of 3 cards. Each time the shuffle button is pressed,
                    the cards are shuffled into different positions. After more than 10 shuffles,
                    the player can guess if they picked the right card. If they did, they win.
                    The main way I programmed this game is by using the document object model.
                    I was able to animate the card’s movement for the game by accessing the object’s CSS and changing
                    it’s positioned each frame. One important thing I learned during the project is how ES6 classes
                    work.
                    By creating a class, I was able to store the card’s HTML reference, current position,
                    and its future position, so that I can animate all the cards moving without overlapping,
                    which was my biggest struggle during programming.
                    Since the movements of the cards are completely randomized, sometimes they overlapped with each
                    other, preventing the player from choosing the right card. I stopped this by creating lists of
                    every possible position and transferring the contents of that list onto another empty list
                    in a random order to tell each card where it must go.
                    Ideas I have of improving it is by making the game based on a 3x3 grid instead of a line.
                    Overall, I am proud of the game that I have made.

1. I added two different biquad filters, one for treble and one for bass.

2. The sprite I created is of a triangle based off the trs exercise, who's position is based off of the value of the audio.
They are replacing the emboss effect since it doesn't look well with the visualiser. 

3. In my JSON file, I added the title of the project, the music data, and instructions on how to use the app.

4. I did not expand much upon the original file. I'd give myself a 3/15 in creativity. It's not a 0 because there is a concept.

5. For HW3, the project has been converted to TypeScript, and then transpiled into ES5. 
I separated the classes, enums, and interfaces into different files and imported them to the files that use them.
I made visual changes to make the circle's colors resemble the sun, and improve the interface with bulma, including adding an about.html page.
